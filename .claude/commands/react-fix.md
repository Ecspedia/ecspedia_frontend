## Command: react-fix

- Run `npm run build` to reproduce the latest build-time errors.
- Investigate and fix any TypeScript, ESLint, or runtime issues surfaced by the build.
- Re-run `npm run build` until it passes.
- Do not skip failing steps; keep iterating until the build succeeds or you are blocked.
